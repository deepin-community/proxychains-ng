ProxyChains-ng (proxychains4) for Debian
========================================

To ensure co-existence with legacy proxychains3, the configuration file
of proxychains4 is installed as /etc/proxychains4.conf. It has a
lower priority than /etc/proxychains.conf.

Proxychains4 should work with the config of old proxychains3. However,
if you find any regressions, please file a bug against proxychains4 package.
