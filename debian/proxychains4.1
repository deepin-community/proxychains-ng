proxychains4 [ \-f \fIconfigfile.conf\fR ] <\fIprogram\fP>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
This program forces any tcp connection made by any given tcp client to follow through proxy (or proxy chain). It is a kind of proxifier.
.LP 
It acts like sockscap / premeo / eborder driver (intercepts TCP calls).
.LP 
This version (v4) supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers.
Auth\-types: socks \- "user/pass" , http \- "basic".

.SS
When to use it?
.IP 1) 4
When the only way to get "outside" from your LAN is through proxy server.
.IP 2) 4
When you are behind restrictive firewall which filters outgoing connections to some ports.
.IP 3) 4
When you want to use two (or more) proxies in chain:
.br 
like: your_host <\-\-> proxy1 <\-\-> proxy2 <\-\-> target_host
.br 
.IP 4) 4
When you want to "proxify" some programs with no proxy support built\-in (like telnet).
.IP 5) 4
When you don't want to pay for eBorder / premeo socks driver :)

.SS
Some cool features:

.IP \(bu 4
This program can mix different proxy types in the same chain. For instance:

.RS
your_host <\-\->socks5 <\-\-> http <\-\-> socks4 <\-\-> http <\-\-> target_host
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
Different chaining options are supported. For instance:

.RS
.IP \(bu 4
take random proxy from the list
.IP \(bu 4
chain proxies in exact order
.IP \(bu 4
chain proxies in dynamic order (smart exclude dead proxies from chain)
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
You can use it with any TCP client application, even network scanners.
Yes, yes \- you can make portscan via proxy (or chained proxies) for example
with Nmap scanner by fyodor (www.insecure.org/nmap).

proxychains nmap \-sT \-PO \-p 80 \-iR  (find some webservers through proxy)

.LP 
NOTE: to run suid/sgid programs(like ssh) through proxychains you have to be root
.SH "FILES"
.LP 
proxychains looks for config file in following order:
.RS
.TP
file listed in environment variable \fBPROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE\fR or provided as a \fI\-f\fR argument to proxychains script or binary.
.TP 
.I ./proxychains.conf
.TP 
.I $(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf
.TP 
.I /etc/proxychains.conf
.TP
.I /etc/proxychains4.conf
.RE
.LP 
More information is provided in \fI/etc/proxychains4.conf\fR file.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
To run this program the standard way type:
.EX
proxychains telnet targethost.com
.EE
.PP
In this example, it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies) specified by proxychains.conf.
.TP
To run this program with custom configuration file:
.EX
proxychains -f /etc/proxychains-other.conf telnet targethost2.com
.EE
.PP
In this example, it will use a different configuration file as specified to connect to targethost2.com host.
